  >> When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object 
    Model of the page.

    The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:


    
    Every web page resides inside a browser window, which can be considered as an object.
A document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window. The 
document object has various properties that refer to other objects which allow access to 
and modification of the document content.
The way a document content is accessed and modified is called the Document Object 
Model, or DOM. The objects are organized in a hierarchy. This hierarchical structure 
applies to the organization of objects in a web document. 
Following is a simple hierarchy of a few important objects: 
There are several DOMs in existence. The following sections explain each of these DOMs 
in detail and describe how you can use them to access and modify the document content. 
 The Legacy DOM: This is the model which was introduced in early versions of 
JavaScript language. It is well supported by all browsers, but allows access only to 
certain key portions of documents, such as forms, form elements, and images.
 The W3C DOM: This document object model allows access and modification of all 
document content and is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 
This model is supported by almost all the modern browsers.
 The IE4 DOM: This document object model was introduced in Version 4 of 
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser. IE 5 and later versions include support for 
most basic W3C DOM features.
